# Fundamentals of C# ðŸš€

Hello, everyone! How's it going? ðŸ˜Š

This repository serves as a journey log, documenting my learning process of a new language.

I'll be consistently updating this repo, along with a corresponding Notion page where I'll be making most of my notes.

Feel free to explore, and any input or feedback is greatly appreciated! ðŸŒŸ
